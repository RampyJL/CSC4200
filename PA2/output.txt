Response from server: b'Hello there (\'149.149.2.105\', 46948). Here is another random quote of wisdom for you:Rule: "You shouldn\'t have to open up a black box and take it apart to find out you\'ve been pushing the wrong buttons!" Corollary: "Every black box should have at least TWO blinking lights: "Paper Jam" and "Service Required" (or equivalent).", Steven D. Majewski, 9 Sep 1993\n'

Response from server: b'Some rejected alternate names for "Monty Python\'s Flying Circus":1 2 3 / It\'s Them! / Arthur Megapode\'s Flying Circus / The Horrible Earnest Megapode / The Panic Show / The Plastic Mac Show / Ow! It\'s Colin Plint! / Vaseline Review / Vaseline Parade / The Keen Show / Brian\'s Flying Circus / The Year of the Stoat / Cynthia Fellatio\'s Flying Circus / Owl Stretching Time / The Whizzo Easishow! (Guaranteed to last 1/2 hour! Money back if not!), From Kim "Howard" Johnson\'s Life Before and After Monty Python. It\'s interesting to contemplate what Python would have been called if one of these names had been chosen.'
